Count Sort step:
iterate over given array of size n and find maximum value
Create another array of size k where k = max(n)
iterate over the given array and increment indexes that match values being iterated over in the k size array
then add all elements in the k size array at i, starting at index 1, with the element in i - 1
this will give us a look up table for where elements need to be inserted into the returned list
to be sorted and maintain their relative order
we then iterate backwards through the original array and use our look up table to place them in the correct 
index in the array to be returned
we do this by going to the index that matches the current i in the original array and decrementing the value stored at the index
and using the decremented value to place the value from the original array into the index, the decremented value

my program broke at around 500,000,000
