made my class extend comparable for generic data types
implemented the psuedo code
	algorithim cuts the array in half then checks the value agaisnt the partition element
	this comparison decides whether the right or left sub array is used for the next step which is 
	running the first step on the smaller sub array
	changed the comparison part of the algorithim to use the generic types
	compareTo.method
