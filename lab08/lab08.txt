Began by creating the project and making my three classes
for model, view, and controller

in the model I used my int2darray class created in a previous class

In the constructor of the model I created an instance of the int2darray class.
I use this object in order to get and return the 2 d array as well as randomize the array.
I wrote new helper methods in my int2darray class to accomplish this.

To get a new random number between -255 to 255 I used a random object's nextInt() method
I passed (255 + 1 + 255) then subtracted 255 from the random number effectively creating a range I wanted

I also made the model observable as well as making my controller an observer

I gave the model two methods I need to finish sortRows() and sortCols() but I made to sure to add
notifyObservers calls

In my controller class I made a constructor and in that constructor a model is created using the
width and height input and it adds itself as an observer of the model

My view was also given a constructor to save the width and height.
