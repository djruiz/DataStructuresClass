Students portion of lab
-----------------------------------
I decided to give students two properties a major and a nem
gave it a constructor to requrie a name to identify the student


Then gave the class a method to set the major

Added getter functions to get the name of students and the major

I then created a toString method to test students and used my get methods to return a string neatly formatted with the students name and major

I then created an array of students and created 3 student instances and tested them all by printing each student in the array
