Used an arraylist of linked lists to hold my 'bins'
went through the new arraylist and initialized empty linked lists
then iterated over input array and use the value to access that index value of my array of linked list
and added that value to the linked list in that index
once this loop is completed we have all the numbers in sorted order and jsut need to take them from
their linked list and change the values of the original list
you can do this by looping over the arraylist and using a while loop to check that the linkedlist
is empty, if it is not use pop to remove an element and place it into the next avaliable index in the original array
----- used counter to track next avaliable index.
