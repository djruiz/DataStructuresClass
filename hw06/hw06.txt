Making my floodIt method
- checked all neighbors of the elements in my flooded linked list
- made sure that they were on the board and not already in the flooded linked list
- if it met these conditions I checked to see if it matched the color that was selected
 - if it did then I added it to the linkedlist of flooded coordinates

my floodfill method iterates over the whole list of flooded elements and checks each for these conditions
so the method takes O(n), n being the amount of coordinates currently in the flooded list which in the worst case
will be k - 1, k being all coordinates in game


for my autoplay method
-wrote a greedy algorithim
-I checked each member of the flooded linked list and kept track of neighbors colors
-made sure they were on board and not in the list already
- kept an array whose indexes represented colors and values represented the total occurences
  of colors seen by neighbors to coordinates in the flooded list
- the index with the largest value becomes the color that my autoplay chooses at each turn ensuring that
  at each turn the largest possible amount of tiles is added to the flooded region.
