created the two helper funcitons 
relax - which takes two vertices and compares the possible distances to get to one of the nodes
minVertex - initializes a value to first unvisted vertex and compares this to the rest of the unvisited
to get the smallest distance

wrote an implementation of dijkstra based on the text book psuedocode using these two helper functions


wrote tests
