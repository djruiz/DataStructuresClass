created a public interface DeckADT

chose methods initialize(), drawRandomCard(), drawTopCardFromDeck(), and pushCardonBottomofDeck

I decided to model my deck using an ArrayList

when initializing I chose to use a for loop that ran from 1 to 13
I used a switch case that added 4 new cards to the deck at each for loop iteration
I added cases to 1, 11, 12, and 13 to represent facecards and aces

drawRandomCard() - used random object to generate a number between 0 and 52 and returned and removed the card at the corresponding position

drawTopCardFromDeck() - removed and returned first element of the deck

pushCaronBottomofDeck - simple add using built in arraylist method

in tweeter used an array list to string together TweetClass objects

add() used arraylist add method
get() tweetclass checked each tweetclass author and returned if it matched the string
remove() checks each tweetclass and check their authors to see if a match, if so remove the tweetclass from thetweeter
