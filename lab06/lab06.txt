created an array list to hold tweets in my tweets collection class

I created two methods for the tweet collection class outside of basic arraylist operations

One to find tweets by a certain author and one to return tweets where a given user is mentioned
- both of these methods return an tweetcollection object holding tweet objects that fit the criteria

To parse through tweets I used substring method and indexof method to seperate author from content based on the first space to create a tweetcollection object to test on

to find tweets by a given author I looped through the tweet collections arraylist and created a getAuthor mehtod in the tweets class.
I compared each tweets author at a given index in the collection to the given author

to find all tweets with a user mentioned I looked through each tweet looking for an @ symbol then used the size of the given username to check
that substsring following the @ sign.  if the user name matches I add it to the tweetcollections object to be returned
